    "We used the re.sub function in part 1 to replace all occurrences of the RE pattern in a string with repl, substituting all occurrences unless max is specified. This method returns a string that has been changed. We're attempting to create a modified string so that we can apply machine learning models to it. The first expression removes all non-word characters and the underscore (_) from reviews. The second expression removes a single whitespace character, then a group of capital and lowercase characters, and finally white spaces. In review, the third expression removes the string that begins with uppercase or lowercase characters and ends with multiple white spaces. Multiple white spaces are removed with the fourth expression. The Lasr expression is used to eliminate a set of numeric values from a set of reviews.\n",

      "year ago when darling lili played on tv it wa always the pan and scan version which hated and decided to wait and see the film in it proper widescreen format so when saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrew blake edward opus decided to purchase and watch it once and for all br br boy what terrible film it so bad and on so many level that really do not know where to start in describing where and when it go so horribly wrong looking at it now it obvious to any fan of movie that blake edward created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other director had struck gold with andrew in musical mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrew wa snubbed from starring in project made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personality never knowing who or what it is some specific scene are good or effective but a whole it just doesn work at all to point of it being very embarrassing br br mind you the version on the dvd is the director cut or in this case let salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edward cut scene from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film move along with no idea of what it is we are minute into it and we still don know what going on or why we re watching what going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she wa she ever responsible for someone death instead we watch thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo thoroughly bored looking julie andrew thing aren helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why doe julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given u some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given u some impetuous to the sluggish proceeding there no catalyst in this story br br one only ha to look at the cut scene to clearly see that edward and the writer just came up with idea inspired by andrew and edward previous success the best or worst example is the scene when andrew and hudson follows group of child who sing in the middle of forest edward channeling sound of music it no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in that scene might have worked on certain level but today that moment reek of desperation there are other plot element directly inspired by andrew edward other film the endless scene of dogfight is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ll give you three guess wa created just to make fun of julie mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing striptease in the act the ending bird eye view of julie running towards hudson plane is another wink at sound of music br br the whole thing is confusing julie play singer born from german father and british mother who life in england but sings her english song in paris you never know exactly where the story take place some moment are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprint off in mid sentence m like what happened here br br the comedy bit are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where peter seller when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson squadron shoot round of bullet at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that one slow moving train there br br the musical moment the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason gave this film star but it effect is diminished considerably because it repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man land is ok even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to group of injured soldier at french hospital making me wonder how many soldier there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying br br the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie look dazed like she on valium but what really kill this ill conceived project is julie playing german spy edward desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing traitor wa good career decision a much a like julie she no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie play german spy she still come across a cloying and cute br br how bad is darling lili even after year since it release blake edward felt he still needed to work on it for it dvd release \n",
