# Data Mining

This repository consists of all my machine learning assignment and projects.

The .csv files are used as data for the Wining Prediction Model.ipynb.

The Project.pdf contains description about Wining Prediction Model.ipynb and xGModel.ipynb.

PichPolt.py is the file that needs to be imported into the xGModel.ipynb.

And I have included my assignments and hackathon files too.

Hope you find this interesting and knowledgable.
